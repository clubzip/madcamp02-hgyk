# Technical issues

### The tabs are implemented in fragment, and a view pager of MainActivity prints the view page for each fragment. 

## 1. Gallery tab
This fragment just set the drawable image for each imageButton.
To implement the zoom function, we use zoomImageFromThumb method which prints a expanded view on screen.

## 2. Contact tab
This fragment contains custom listview. Thus, it contains 'ListViewAdapter' which extends BaseAdapter and 'ListViewItem'.
ListViewAdapter implements Filterable for searching function. Each ListViewItem has three private member variables that contain the information of name, mobile number, and the name of profile image file. ListViewAdapter creates view for each row of custom listview using this data. Initially, these data are from JSON file at internal storage.

The addition and remove of contact data is implemented by rewrite the JSON file. To prints the changed listview, the activities for addition and remove are start by calling startActivityForResult. And the Fragment renew itself in the method 'onActivityResult.'

The calling and Sending message is implemented with Uri.parse method.

## 3. Calendar tab
Main screen composed of fragment.
Implement the basic form by implementing the API of java.util.calendar
Implement DB by using android Room API
Implement DB's addition and modification process by using Dao
Use Decorate class to decorate dates (inherit DayViewDecorator)
